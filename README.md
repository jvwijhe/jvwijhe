### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my Github page.
I'm Jens, a Fullstack developer from  Elburg, The NetherlandsðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±  I am the co-founder and owner of Beter Bekend. An awesome web development and e-commerce agency based in Elburg, The Netherlands.

Another huge passion of mine is hiking. Last year I hiked the E5 through the Alps. Since I like to share my adventures, I thought a hiking blog would be a good Idea. That's why I've build a hiking blog in Laravel, Vue and TailwindCSS (my favourite tech stack).

Lately I have been filming some of my hikes. Feel free to check out my Youtube channel.
