### Join me on a hike
Another huge passion of mine is hiking. Last year I [hiked the E5 through the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSM0VAqSOeg). Since I like to share my adventures, I thought a [hiking blog](https://www.bergfanaten.nl) would be a good Idea. That's why I've build a platform where hiking fans can connect with Laravel, Vue and TailwindCSS (my favourite tech stack).

Lately I have been filming some of my hikes. Feel free to check out my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuqx6IneZ6jm0_1V-YkpSDQ)
