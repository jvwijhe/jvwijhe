### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my Github page.
I'm Jens, a Fullstack developer from  Elburg, The NetherlandsðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±  I am the co-founder and owner of [Beter Bekend](https://www.beterbekend.nl). An awesome web development and e-commerce agency based in Elburg, The Netherlands. At the moment I am also working at my [developer portfolio](https://www.jvw.dev)



### Join me on a hike
Another huge passion of mine is hiking. Last year I [hiked the E5 through the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSM0VAqSOeg). Since I like to share my adventures, I thought a [hiking blog](https://www.jens.global) would be a good Idea. That's why I've build a hiking blog in Laravel, Vue and TailwindCSS (my favourite tech stack).

Lately I have been filming some of my hikes. Feel free to check out my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuqx6IneZ6jm0_1V-YkpSDQ)
